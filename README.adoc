**The definitive Chapel static site generator.**

== Overview

parallax-ssg is a parallel-first static site generator written in Chapel.
It leverages Chapel's built-in parallelism for high-performance site builds
across multiple cores or even distributed systems.

== Language Enforcement

[IMPORTANT]
====
This SSG **MUST** be written in Chapel. No exceptions.

Forbidden languages for SSG logic:

* Python
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* C++/OpenMP
* Any language other than Chapel

The **ONLY** non-Chapel code allowed is the ReScript MCP adapter in `adapters/`.
====

== Features

* First-class parallel iterators for content processing
* Automatic parallelization of page generation
* Distributed computing support for massive sites
* Clean, productive syntax
* Excellent performance scaling

== Requirements

* Chapel 1.30+
